    <!--
      There are two ways to define content for your tabs:

      1. Wrap each tabbed section in a blank `<div></div>`.
         Sections must correspond with the order of the tabs you specified.

      2. Wrap each tabbed section in the provided block helper (RECOMMENDED!).
         `{{#tabContent slug="nameOfSlug"}} ... {{/tabContent}}`
         These can be defined in any order you like.
